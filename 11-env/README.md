# Saving the Environment

## Why does this section exist?

From the perspective of a prospectus or professional web developer, climate change may not be the most important concern for our day-to-day work.
However, the truth is not really worth ignoring, since a developer's work does have carbon footprint.
Therefore it's high time we start considering our initiatives and be prudent about how our work complies with the current global concerns pertaining to the environment, especially climate change.

We may not consider this fact, but the truth remains that the Internet itself is a colossal consumer of electrical power.
For obvious reasons, this power is generated through various means of conventional or non conventional sources, which commonly includes fossil fuels in most of the countries of the globe.

As software engineers, it's understandable to an extent that that this is not a major related to what we do and how we serve our users.
However, it may seem that we have very minimal or no influence over this issue, but the truth is far from what we are thinking right now.
There are multiple approaches being adopted in order to mitigate the adverse effects of climate changes within the coding domain as well.

So, what can be our role in the global fight against climate change?
It should be easy to understand that IT servers can be supplied with renewable energy as an alternative, but will that effort suffice?

One of the biggest wins, in terms of making websites more sustainable, is the performance - both in terms of enhanced user experience and website sustainability, which are neatly intertwined.
This includes the functions of the server and the client, and the intermediary connecting networks that transmit data/information between them.

## Focus on Reducing Network Requests

Network requests are easy measurable KPIs (key performance indicators) within a network, and hence serves as a good starting point of focus.
There are numerous HTTP requests within an application that are not usually necessary for the overall functionalities.

This may represent a relatively meager saving in terms of the overall application structure, but we can establish a philosophy of pruning unwanted codes in order to minimize requests from our pages that can both improve the overall performance significantly, and in turn contribute towards reduced resource utilization of the overall network.
Thus, indirectly as it may seem, but still helping reduce the network demand of power.

## Habit of Writing Simple Code

When talking about serious and critical performance enhancements, it's mandatory to bear in mind that every character of code counts.
In terms of network level description, we understand that every character represents a byte, and even after being compressed by gzip, they still up considerable amount of weight.
As we all know, CSS is one such domain where we often see a lot of such bloats.
When starting from scratch, it's a good practice (hygiene factor) to think more deeply about how we write CSS and JavaScript in the first place.

## Remember The Basics

It's today's era of technological advancements and availability of information, it's a no-brainer that abundance of information exists around us about the following.
However, we should never get complacent and forget about them.
Alongside above all, we must always minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and concatenate wherever appropriate and possible.

## Server-side Performance

So far, our focus has been almost entirely on the front-end part of the network elements, but a lot of our discussions would be counted irrelevant if we ignore the role of servers (IT infrastructures) that hold a huge scope of optimization.
A lot has been emphasised on the necessity of enabling gzip size compression at all times and within all server levels.

We must practise using HTTP2 over HTTPS as HTTPS opens up a world of new web technologies, like service workers, that allow us to treat the network itself as a convenient and hygiene environment.

## In Conclusion

By now, I hope it was convincing that the effort put forward to  make the websites more sustainable is a worthy one, especially when it's given that in the process we also make our websites:

1. More performant
1. More user-friendly
1. More accessible
1. More server-friendly
1. More SEO-friendly

It may, for obvious notion, may occur to some people that the idea of sustainable web design - which is not unreasonable - is that it seems to be a very minute concession to the overall and greater environmental cause which we've spoken about here.
There is no doubt that the impact we can have depends on how busy the websites and environments are on which we're working.
However, apart from helping the web become a bit more environmentally friendly, we all as individual level contributors can take cumulative steps towards sustainable web designing, which should fundamentally be noted as a best practice in web designing.
